# Intro into Elixir

This repo contains the slides and the Dockerfile used for a introduction-talk about
Elixir.

## The Dockerfile

As it is not yet pushed to Docker Hub...build it yourself.

```
cd Dockerfile
docker build -t foo/bar .
docker run -ti foo/bar
```

Et voila, the Elixir REPL.


## The slides

Just open slides/index.html and you are good to go. These are based on reveal.js.
